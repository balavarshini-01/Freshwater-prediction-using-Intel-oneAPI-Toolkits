# Freshwater-prediction-using-Intel-oneAPI-Toolkits
The availability of fresh water is crucial for sustaining life and development, but it is increasingly threatened by climate change and human activities. To address this issue, machine learning techniques have been applied to predict and manage fresh water resources. In this project, we explore the use of Intel One API machine learning to develop a model for fresh water reduction. We will train and evaluate our model on a large dataset of water usage and climate data, and assess its accuracy and generalization ability. Our goal is to provide a scalable and efficient solution for fresh water prediction using Intel oneAPI toolkits, which can help communities and industries to optimize their water usage and reduce waste.

The dataset contains the temperature, DO, pH, conductivity of Water. Attribute selection is the first step in which the best attribute is selected. Then Pre-Processing of the dataset is done. Then the accuracy is achieved using the **Principle Component Analysis (PCA)**. The algorithm with high accuracy rate is used in the Fresh Water Prediction. Finally, we can easily predict whether the water is fresh water is safe for human consumption or not.

This project demonstrates how to use Intel oneAPI toolkits to create a machine learning model that can predict whether a water source is freshwater or not. The project uses various oneAPI libraries, such as  daal4py, and sklearnex, to optimize the data processing, feature engineering, and model training steps. The project also deploys the model on Azure Cloud and provides an API for users to access the prediction results. The project is based on one of the themes of IntelÂ® oneAPI Hackathon for Open Innovation and aims to contribute to global water security and environmental sustainability efforts.
